ðŸ“Š COVID-19 Data Analysis 

__Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze COVID-19 statistics using SQL queries. The analysis focuses on understanding case distribution, recovery and mortality rates, testing coverage, and trends over time.

__Tools
SQLite â€“ Database engine
DB Browser for SQLite â€“ GUI for database management
Kaggle COVID-19 dataset â€“ Data source

 __Mini Guide:
 1.Import dataset into SQLite.
 2.Clean and transform data (formatting, nulls).
 3.Create necessary tables and constraints.
 4.Write analytical queries (top countries, daily trends).
 5.Use GROUP BY and window functions for trends.
 6.Export result views and summary report.
